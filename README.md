# Coursera - Machine Learning

# What's this?

This repo contains my solution of practical assignments in [2015 Coursera Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
If you are taking the class, feel free to fork my repo and put different solutions in a different branch.
HOWEVER, please DO NOT refer any code in my repo before the due date and NEVER post any code in my repo according to "Stanford Honor Code" below.
Questions or pointing out is always welcome, please send me a mail.

# About this Course

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Honor Code

All students participating in the class must agree to abide by the following code of conduct:

1) I will register for only one account.

2) My answers to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).

3) I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments available to anyone else (except to the extent an assignment explicitly permits sharing solutions). This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any solutions provided by the course staff or others.

4) I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve or hurt the results of others.
